## 🎯 About This Repo

This repository contains **Hak5 Rubber Ducky Payloads** designed for a variety of pentesting and red team operations. Each payload is written in **Ducky Script** and built using the **Payload Studio** software. You'll find the original `.txt` payload files here; you can convert these into `inject.bin` files on your own to deploy them on your Rubber Ducky.
